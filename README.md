Projects to investigate technologies/frameworks which I do not get to play with through work as well as projects/coursework from my university days.

At work I usually work in Java/Python for data pipelining and building services. Unfortunately end up spending an upsetting amount of time debugging on premise services and networking issues - but by no means an expert.

Currently looking to improve my full stack developement (MySQL, Api design, Typescript, React, Redux) and knowledge of Python/Machine learning frameworks.

- Currently working as a Forward Deployed Software Engineer at Palantir Technologies (2018=Present).
- MSc in Humans and Biological Robotics from Imperial College London (2017-2018).
- MEng in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Bristol (2012-2016).
